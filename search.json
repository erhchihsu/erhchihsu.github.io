Standard statistical methods assume simple random sampling (SRS) and independent, identically distributed (IID) data. However, complex survey designs often violate IID assumptions, leading to incorrect standard errors and confidence intervals.\n\nWhy IID Assumptions Fail in Complex Surveys:\n\nClustering (Intraclass correlation): Individuals within clusters (e.g., households, communities) tend to be more similar to each other.\nDesign Effect (DEFF/DEFT): Variance inflation due to survey design.\nFinite Population Correction (FPC): When you sample from a small population without replacement, each selection slightly changes the remaining group, making your estimate more precise. Since most standard error formulas assume sampling with replacement, the Finite Population Correction (FPC) adjusts the standard error downward to account for this.\nMultistage Sampling: Involves stratification, clustering, and unequal probabilities.\nWeights: Sampling weights affect both point estimates and variance estimation."

Thomas\nPoster presentation, AcademyHealth Annual Research Meeting, Minneapolis, MN, June 8, 2025.\nView handout (html)\nView poster (PDF)\n\nWe examined how changes in assisted living (AL) capacity — specifically within 15 miles of each nursing home — influence the prevalence of dementia among NH residents across the U.S. from 2019 to 2021. We found that increasing general AL capacity was associated with a modest but statistically significant reduction in NH dementia prevalence, while memory care AL showed no significant effect, possibly due to higher costs. These findings support the role of AL in delaying or diverting NH entry for individuals with dementia."
