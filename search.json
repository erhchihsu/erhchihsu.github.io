My long-term research goal is to identify ways to improve the well-being of older adults, their caregivers, and the long-term care workforce.

Ultimately, my goal is to inform policy and payment decisions that enhance care quality and support a more sustainable and equitable workforce.\nCurrently, I am working on several projects: (1) a spatial analysis of long-term care market dynamics to examine whether increased assisted living capacity may delay or reduce nursing home admissions among people with dementia; (2) a geospatial study identifying co-located assisted living communities and nursing homes, including analysis of their characteristics and trends over time; and (3) the development of national policy coding databases on assisted living and adult day centers (as part of the RF1 and U54 grants, respectively), which capture how states regulate areas such as staffing, staff training, building requirements, and care processes. These policy data will later be merged with claims datasets to study the impact of regulation on older adults.\nMy dissertation focuses on the role of training requirements in assisted living. Using two national datasets—the National Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Study (NPALS) and the National Dementia Workforce Study (NDWS)—I will explore: (1) the impact of state-level enforcement on assisted living facilities; (2) how facilities adapt to these requirements; (3) how these adaptations affect workforce outcomes; and (4) how workforce practices relate to resident outcomes.\nIn addition, I lead a side project funded by the Center for Equity in Aging at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, which uses longitudinal data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) to examine how engagement in various technology-related activities may influence cognitive functioning in older adults.\nBy training, I am both a public health and nurse scientist.

Standard statistical methods assume simple random sampling (SRS) and independent, identically distributed (IID) data. However, complex survey designs often violate IID assumptions, leading to incorrect standard errors and confidence intervals.\n\nWhy IID Assumptions Fail in Complex Surveys:\n\nClustering (Intraclass correlation): Individuals within clusters (e.g., households, communities) tend to be more similar to each other.\nDesign Effect (DEFF/DEFT): Variance inflation due to survey design.\nFinite Population Correction (FPC): When you sample from a small population without replacement, each selection slightly changes the remaining group, making your estimate more precise. Since most standard error formulas assume sampling with replacement, the Finite Population Correction (FPC) adjusts the standard error downward to account for this.\nMultistage Sampling: Involves stratification, clustering, and unequal probabilities.\nWeights: Sampling weights affect both point estimates and variance estimation."
