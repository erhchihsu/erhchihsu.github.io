    "text": "I am a PhD student at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing. My long-term research goal is to identify ways to improve the well-being of older adults, their caregivers, and the long-term care workforce. My work spans the long-term care continuum, from community-based services to institutional settings such as assisted living (AL) communities and nursing homes (NH). Ultimately, my goal is to inform policy and payment decisions that enhance care quality and support a more sustainable and equitable workforce.\nCurrently, I am working on several projects: (1) a spatial analysis of long-term care market dynamics to examine whether increased assisted living capacity may delay or reduce nursing home admissions among people with dementia; (2) a geospatial study identifying co-located assisted living communities and nursing homes, including analysis of their characteristics and trends over time; and (3) the development of national policy coding databases on assisted living and adult day centers (as part of the RF1 and U54 grants, respectively), which capture how states regulate areas such as staffing, staff training, building requirements, and care processes. These policy data will later be merged with claims datasets to study the impact of regulation on older adults.\nMy dissertation focuses on the role of training requirements in assisted living. Using two national datasets—the National Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Study (NPALS) and the National Dementia Workforce Study (NDWS)—I will explore: (1) the impact of state-level enforcement on assisted living facilities; (2) how facilities adapt to these requirements; (3) how these adaptations affect workforce outcomes; and (4) how workforce practices relate to resident outcomes.\nIn addition, I lead a side project funded by the Center for Equity in Aging at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, which uses longitudinal data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) to examine how engagement in various technology-related activities may influence cognitive functioning in older adults.\nBy training, I am both a public health and nurse scientist. Professionally, I have worked as a registered nurse in a geriatric ward and as a mixed-methods specialist for a Washington State Department of Health project evaluating emergency cardiac and stroke systems of care. Outside of my academic work, I’m a dedicated bird watcher!\nThis site includes my publications, presentations, and my projects, as well as a learning blog.
